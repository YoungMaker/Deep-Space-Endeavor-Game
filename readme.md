# Deep Space Endeavor
A 2D Space shooter written in Slick with LWJGL.
Uses Open GL hardware acceleration, and Open AL for audio

A project I completed in late 2013 without the use of github. I am uploading it now to share it with others.
This project is open source and has no restrictions. If you want to use it and re-make it into something else, I'd be flattered. Completely open source

### installation
Download the DSE_1.15B.jar and the resources directory and put them in the same directory
Run the DSE_1.15B.jar file (latest build). Alternatively, you can download and run it with the start.bat to read the console output

### Instructions
* Space to select/advance and fire
* WASD to move
* Shoot 6 blue targeted ships in a row to gain a powerup.
* The first (Green) health item is automatically applied when you fly over it, the rest must be selected with x . Once you apply a powerup, the next will be a health and the pattern restarts
  * Health: automatically applied
  * Speed: Increases ship movement speed
  * Armor: Blocks 1 damage tick
  * Hyper Gun: Unlocks the center gun that does much more damage and has unlimited range
  * Full Restore: Fully restores health
  * Shield: Blocks several damage ticks before it expires
* There are 4 levels and a boss fight for each. There are checkpoints in each level, so that when you die, you go back to the begining
* You get 4 lives before the game restarts.

###### Have fun and don't die out there, on an Endeavor Deep in space.
