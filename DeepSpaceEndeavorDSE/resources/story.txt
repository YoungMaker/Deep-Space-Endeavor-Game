 The Sapphire Orb was the first infinite
     source of Energy in the galaxy.
    It was invaluable to the federation
        but they needed to risk 
      transporting it to a scientific 
             space station.
         That was our mission.
         To give power to the 
        always forward drive of
               Science. 
        But fate had other ideas.
